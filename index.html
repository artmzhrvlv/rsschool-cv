####3.During this course, I want to master front end development. I think this course has a huge advantage, namely a lot of practice and a minimum of lectures, which motivates you to devote a lot of time to your favorite business every day. In the future, I plan to take a course on React upon successful completion of this course. In order to develop websites and web applications independently and responsibly in the future.
**4.At the university, we studied C++ and JAVA. I was personally interested in the C# language and the .Net framework** 5.

```
const func = (num) => {
  if (num > 0) {
    return num - 1;
  }
  return num + 1;
};
```

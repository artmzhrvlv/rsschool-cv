<h3><p>3.During this course, I want to master front end development.</p>
  <p> I think this course has a huge advantage, namely a lot of practice</p>
  <p>and a minimum of lectures, which motivates you to devote a lot of </p>
  <p> time to your favorite business every day. In the future, I plan</p>
  <p>to take a course on React upon successful completion of this course.</p>
  <p>In order to develop websites and web applications independently</p>
  <p> and responsibly in the future.</p></h3>
